WWW::TinySong version 0.04_04
=============================

tinysong.com is a web app that can be queried for a song and returns a
tiny URL, allowing you to listen to the song for free online and share
it with friends. WWW::TinySong is a Perl interface to this service,
allowing you to programmatically search its underlying database. (Yes,
for those who are curious, the module currently works by scraping.)

Warning: this release breaks backwards compatibility by doing away with
the object-oriented way of using this module because I've decided it was
overkill and there's a better to make customization possible. Given the
young age and obscurity of this module, I don't anticipate it will affect
anyone's code, but here's the obligatory warning just in case.
