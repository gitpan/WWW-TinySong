WWW::TinySong version 0.04_01
=============================

tinysong.com is a web app that can be queried for a song and returns a
tiny URL, allowing you to listen to the song for free online and share
it with friends. WWW::TinySong is a Perl interface to this service,
allowing you to programmatically search its underlying database. (Yes,
for those who are curious, the module currently works by scraping.)

This developer release contains updated tests and documentation. It also
relaxes the required Perl version from 5.8 to 5.6 (if this breaks some
test, I'll know I shouldn't have done it).
